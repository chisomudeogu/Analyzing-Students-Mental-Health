# üéì Exploring International Students' Mental Health Using SQL

## üìò Project Overview

This project analyzes how the **length of stay** impacts the **mental health scores** of international students in a Japanese university. Using PostgreSQL, I explored relationships between students' duration of stay and their levels of:

- Depression (PHQ-9 test)
- Social connectedness (SCS test)
- Acculturative stress (ASISS test)

> ‚úÖ **Goal:** Understand whether mental health improves or worsens over time for international students and support insights with data.
